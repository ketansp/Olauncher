# What is Launch0?

Launch0 is a productivity-focused, open-source Android launcher. It replaces your home screen with a fast, text-based interface — instant app access, powerful gestures, and a streamlined layout that keeps you focused on getting things done.

It is a fork of [Olauncher](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher) by [tanujnotes](https://github.com/tanujnotes). All credit for the original design and implementation goes to the Olauncher team.

## Why a productivity launcher?

The average person checks their phone 96 times a day. Launch0 helps you make each interaction count:

- **Launch apps faster** with text shortcuts and instant search
- **Stay focused** with a clutter-free home screen
- **Track your screen time** to stay aware of your usage
- **Use gesture shortcuts** to access apps and controls in a single swipe

## Quick Start

1. Install Launch0 from the Play Store or build from source
2. Set it as your default launcher
3. Swipe up to see all apps
4. Long press anywhere for settings

::: tip
Start typing an app name in the app drawer to auto-launch it.
