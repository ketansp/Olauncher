# Download

Get Launch0 for your Android device.

## Latest Release

Download the latest APK directly from GitHub:

**[Download Launch0 APK](https://github.com/ketansp/launch0/releases/latest/download/app-release.apk)**

You can also browse all releases on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ketansp/launch0/releases).

## Installation

Since the APK is installed outside the Play Store, you may see a couple of prompts. This is normal for sideloaded open-source apps.

1. Download the APK file using the link above.
2. Open the downloaded file on your Android device.
3. If prompted, tap **Settings** and enable **Allow from this source**.
4. If Google Play Protect shows **"App blocked to protect your device"**, tap **"More details"** and then **"Install anyway"**.
5. Tap **Install**.
6. Once installed, press the Home button and select **Launch0** as your launcher.

::: tip Why does Play Protect block this?
Google Play Protect flags apps that aren't distributed through the Play Store and haven't been reviewed by Google. This is standard for all sideloaded apps — it does not mean the app is harmful. Launch0 is fully open source and you can verify the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ketansp/launch0).
